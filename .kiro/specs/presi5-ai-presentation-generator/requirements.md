# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Presi5 is a comprehensive AI-powered presentation generator that transforms user text prompts into fully animated HTML presentations with synchronized audio narration. The application leverages advanced AI models through OpenRouter API, provides user authentication and credit management through Supabase, and generates professional presentations with voice narration using Google's Gemini TTS service.
